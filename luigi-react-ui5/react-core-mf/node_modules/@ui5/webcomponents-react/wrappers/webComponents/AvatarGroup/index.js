/**
 * Displays a group of avatars arranged horizontally. It is useful to visually showcase a group of related avatars, such as, project team members or employees. The component allows you to display the avatars in different sizes, depending on your use case. The `AvatarGroup` component has two group types:
 *
 * *   `Group` type: The avatars are displayed as partially overlapped on top of each other and the entire group has one click/tap area.
 * *   `Individual` type: The avatars are displayed side-by-side and each avatar has its own click/tap area.
 *
 * __Note:__ This component is a web component developed by the UI5 Web Components’ team.
