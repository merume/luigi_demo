/**
 * The `ViewSettingsDialog` component helps the user to sort data within a list or a table. It consists of several lists like `Sort order` which is built-in and `Sort By` and `Filter By` lists, for which you must be provide items(`SortItem` & `FilterItem` respectively) These options can be used to create sorters for a table. The `ViewSettingsDialog` interrupts the current application processing as it is the only focused UI element and the main screen is dimmed/blocked. The `ViewSettingsDialog` is modal, which means that user action is required before returning to the parent window is possible.
 *
 * __Note:__ This component is a web component developed by the UI5 Web Componentsâ€™ team.
