 * Enables users to navigate between items by providing a list of links to previous steps in the user's navigation path. It helps the user to be aware of their location within the application and allows faster navigation.
 *
 * The last three steps can be accessed as links directly, while the remaining links prior to them are available in a drop-down menu.
 *
 * You can choose the type of separator to be used from a number of predefined options.
 *
