/**
 * The `Card` is a component that represents information in the form of a tile with separate header and content areas. The content area of a `Card` can be arbitrary HTML content. The header can be used through slot `header`. For which there is a `Card-header` component to achieve the card look and fill. Note: We recommend the usage of `Card-header` for the header slot, so advantage can be taken for keyboard handling, styling and accessibility.
 *
 * __Note:__ This component is a web component developed by the UI5 Web Componentsâ€™ team.
