/**
 * A plugin hook that marks parent rows as indeterminate if a child row is selected in `MultiSelect` mode.
 * When using this hook, it is recommended to also select all sub-rows when selecting a row. (`reactTableOptions={{ selectSubRows: true }}`)
 *
 * __Note:__ The `indeterminate` state has a higher priority than the `selected` state. Therefore, a row can be selected and indeterminate at the same time. This can for example happen, if `selectSubRows: true` is set and a row with sub-rows is selected and then a sub-row is unselected.
 *
 * @param {event} onIndeterminateChange Fired when the indeterminate state of rows is changed.
