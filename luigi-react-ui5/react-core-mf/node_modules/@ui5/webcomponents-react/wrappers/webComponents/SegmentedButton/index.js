 * The `SegmentedButton` shows a group of items. When the user clicks or taps one of the items, it stays in a pressed state. It automatically resizes the items to fit proportionally within the component. When no width is set, the component uses the available width.
 *
 * **Note:** There can be just one selected `item` at a time.
 *
 * __Note:__ This component is a web component developed by the UI5 Web Componentsâ€™ team.
