/**
 * The `BarcodeScannerDialog` component provides barcode scanning functionality for all devices that support the `MediaDevices.getUserMedia()` native API. Opening the dialog launches the device camera and scans for known barcode formats.
 *
 * A `scanSuccess` event fires whenever a barcode is identified and a `scanError` event fires when the scan failed (for example, due to missing permisions).
 *
 * Internally, the component uses the zxing-js/library third party OSS. For a list of supported barcode formats, see the <ui5-link target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zxing-js/library">zxing-js/library</ui5-link> documentation
 *
 * __Note:__ This component is a web component developed by the UI5 Web Componentsâ€™ team.
